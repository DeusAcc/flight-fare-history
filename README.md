# Flight fare history — what routes actually cost, measured

**890,309 observed fares on 50,143 city pairs, collected continuously since
2026-06-14.** Not a search engine snapshot: the same routes are observed again and again, so what
you get here is the *distribution* of a route's price, which is the thing a live search can never
tell you. Updated daily. Source: <https://piratefly.com/?src=github>

## Files

| File | One row per | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| `fares-by-month.csv` | route × departure month | observations, median, 10th percentile, minimum |
| `routes.csv` | route | observations, median, minimum, months covered, first/last observation |
| `summary.json` | today | totals, observation window, published thresholds |
| `daily/<date>.json` | each day | the immutable daily snapshot — this directory is the series |

Prices are in EUR, per one-way fare as advertised, including the price shown at collection time.

## What it answers that a flight search cannot

A search engine tells you today's price. This tells you whether today's price is *good*: the median
of what the same route has actually cost, the 10th percentile (what a good deal looks like), the
lowest ever observed, and which departure months are cheap on that route. That judgement needs a
history, and a history cannot be reconstructed after the fact — which is why this file exists.

The live version of this judgement, per route and in one call, is a free public MCP server
(`flight_price_verdict`, `cheapest_months`, `when_to_book`): <https://piratefly.com/?src=github>

## Live data: the API

This file is a daily aggregate. The same history, per route and current to the last observation,
is a JSON API: free without a key (100 requests/day per IP), and a **Pro plan** that removes the
cap and skips the edge cache, for apps and pipelines that need fresh prices.

## Method, and what it does not cover

- Every row is an observed advertised fare, stored at collection time, never a modelled estimate.
- A route × month group is published only with at least 5 observations; thinner
  groups are left out entirely instead of being filled with a plausible-looking median.
- Observation window: 2026-06-14 → 2026-09-24. Anything older than that does not exist here.
- Coverage follows where fares were found, not a designed sample: city pairs are unevenly
  represented and this is not a random sample of the world's air traffic.
- One-way advertised fares only. No taxes breakdown, no seat class, no availability guarantee, and
  a fare observed is not a fare you can still buy.
